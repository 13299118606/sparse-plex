Introduction
================


This chapter is a background material on basic concepts
in set theory and basic properties of real numbers. 

We look at

* Basic properties of sets
* Concept of a function
* Cartesian products
* Relations
* Notion of order in sets
* Countable and uncountable sets



Concepts are developed sequentially where one concept builds upon
other concepts previously defined. Examples are added wherever 
suitable for better understanding. In examples we 
use sets of real numbers, natural numbers, integers frequently.
Some of their properties may not have been defined before they are 
used in examples. This has been done keeping in mind that the reader
has an intuitive understanding of these numbers and the examples are
easier to visualize.

The presentation in this chapter largely follows :cite:`aliprantis1998principles`.
